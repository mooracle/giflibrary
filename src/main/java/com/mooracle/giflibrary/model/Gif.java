    /** ENTRY 10: Modelling Data with POJOs
     *  1.  One of the most powerful feature in Spring is the ability to use Plain Old Java Object to control the
     *      application. Since POJO is coded for its natural functionality not for the specific framework in which it
     *      will be used, the content of POJO class will be just like any other common Java class with constructor,
     *      getter, and setter, etc.
     *  2.  In this ENTRY 10 we will use POJO to model (to define or to describe) how a Gif as a data should be like
     *      and should behave. Just like any other POJO, Gif.java with have all the attributes inside parameters and
     *      fields and also behaviors in its methods. This Gif.java POJO will be attached to each gif images
     *      uploaded inside the gifs directory
     *      NOTE: since it is new schema uploaded the coding and naming mught slightly different
     *  3.  Inside class Gif put all necessary attributes into declared fields and constructor
     *  4.  Create getter and Setter for all variables (fields)
     *
     *  TODO: NEXT: ENTRY 11: Feeding Data to Our Thymeleaf Templates
